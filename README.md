# Brain-Tumor-Detector-and-Classifier
Sensing the dire need of introduction of machine assisted testing in the 
field of medical science, our team has taken this task of detecting and classifying 
tumors based on societal concerns. The main idea behind brain tumor detection and 
classification using machine learning is to develop algorithms that can analyze 
medical imaging data, such as MRI or CT scans, to accurately identify and categorize 
brain tumors. Deep learning techniques can be applied to automate the process, 
assisting medical professionals in diagnosing and monitoring brain tumors. This 
field aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of tumor detection, segmentation, 
and classification, leading to earlier detection, personalized treatment planning, and 
better patient outcomes. The project involves usage of VGG16, a CNN architecture developed by 
Visual Geometry Group in 2014. This deep neural network consists of 16 layers: 13 
convolution layers and 3 deeply connected layers, to achieve high accuracy for 
image recognition without compromising on the simplicity and uniformity the 
architecture provides. VGG16 has been given preference as it requires a lesser number of inputs to 
adapt and identify features, emphasizes on relative positioning of pixels and rectifies 
the shifts in the positions of pixels. Trained over ImageNet, an image dataset 
consisting of 1 million images within 1,000 categories, VGG16 has become a 
renowned name in the domain of Machine Learning.
